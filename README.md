My first repository on GitHub.


This code contain 3 cpp files and two header files. Header files contain declaration of variables and functions and cpp file contain the code. This code consist of two classes. First class is for addition, subtraction multiplication and division of complex numbers using operator overloading. Exception is used in the division function's denominator.The other class "linkedlist" can handle complex and supports following functios:

1 – Insert at end 
2 – Delete at a given position 
3 – value at position 
4 – insert after a given position 
5 – print the list

In main file, linkedlist stores following numbers: 1– 4 + 5j 2 – 3 – 3j 3 – 4 + 3j
It adds first two numbers and store at last. 1 and 3 are subtracted and stored at last. Multiply 2 and 3 and store at last, divide 1 by 3 and store at last. Element at position 4 is deleted along the last element. Output is printed after every single step. 
Output of the code is: 7+2i 7+2i 0+2i 7+2i 0+2i 12-9i 7+2i 0+2i 12-9i 1+1.66667i 7+2i 0+2i 12-9i 7+2i 0+2i Press any key to continue . . .
